<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jose Garcia. I am a 21 year old man. I currently reside in the state of Maryland, although I do hope to move to colorado soon. 
 I took up coding as a hobby when I was younger, I eventually dropped it due to personal life getting in the way, the picked up again due to a dear friend getting me interested in it again.
 Now I hope in making a career out of this endevor as I explore the world and visit the many sites the world has to offer.
</p>

<p>I have many hobbies outside of coding. I am a self described adrenaline junkie. I love to skateboard, workout at the gym, play airsoft, and other various physical activities.
  I hope to have a chance to go skydiving, complete a multi-day hike, maybe even attempt to climb MT.Everest.
  I would love to participate in a marathon and travel all across the globe. I want to visit Germany, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Great Britain, and Ireland.

<p>Although I may seem like a busy body, I like to relax and lounge around too. I love to cook and bake, read books, play instruments, and just sit next to a cozy fire and fall asleep.
  I don't really have much more to say about myself(I have never been great at this kind of thing)but I do hope it's enough to satiate any curiosity you may have had about silly ol me.
